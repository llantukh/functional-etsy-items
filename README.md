This assignment really tested our Javascript abilities...or lack thereof. I think I am starting to understand functions and nested data much better, but not enough to clearly explain it to someone else. I was able to get most of the answers to match up correctly; except for question number five. There was supposed to be much more data that was to be pulled out of the items array and I was not able to figure out how to do that.

I am still having trouble with syntax. I never know when to use parenthesis, brackets, or quotation marks. Brit and Ben keep saying that comes with time. We're on week three now. Hopefully it clicks sooner than later.
